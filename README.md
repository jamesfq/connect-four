## Connect Four

This code creates a game of Connect Four for two players to play side-by-side.

The game has two modes: `space` and `custom`. The user can either create a default-sized board by using the `space` option, which will allow the two players to play with suns and moons in a starry background, or they can choose their own layout and colors using the `custom` command.

To load the program, input the following command into the terminal while in the ConnectFour directory:
```
javac ConnectDriver.java
```

Then, when you are ready to play the game, input the following final command:
```
java ConnectDriver.java
```

To remove the class files that have been created, type `rm *.class` into the terminal.

Enjoy!
